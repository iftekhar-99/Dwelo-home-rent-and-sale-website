## API Endpoints

### Authentication
- `POST /api/auth/register` - Register new owner
- `POST /api/auth/login` - Owner login

- `GET /api/owner/profile` - Get owner profile
- `PUT /api/owner/profile` - Update owner profile

### Property Management
- `GET /api/owner/properties` - List owner's properties
- `POST /api/owner/properties` - Create new property

## Success Criteria

✅ Owners can complete full property listing in <5 minutes  
✅ All mandatory fields enforced before submission  
✅ Clear visual feedback at every interaction point  
✅ Mobile-responsive layout  
✅ Role-based redirects on login
